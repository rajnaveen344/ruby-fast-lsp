# Module Mixins Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive module mixin support for the Ruby Fast LSP, enabling accurate code navigation and analysis for Ruby's `include`, `extend`, and `prepend` mechanisms. The current implementation provides basic mixin tracking but lacks complete support for complex mixin scenarios, method resolution order (MRO), and advanced mixin patterns commonly used in Ruby applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Mixin Resolution

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer using the LSP, I want accurate goto-definition for methods accessed through mixins so that I can navigate to the correct method definition regardless of how it was mixed in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is called on a class that includes a module THEN the system SHALL find the method definition in the included module
2. WHEN a method is called on a class that extends a module THEN the system SHALL find the method definition in the extended module as a class method
3. WHEN a method is called on a class that prepends a module THEN the system SHALL find the method definition in the prepended module with correct precedence
4. WHEN multiple modules are mixed in THEN the system SHALL respect Ruby's method resolution order (MRO)
5. WHEN a mixin chain exists (module A includes module B) THEN the system SHALL traverse the complete chain

### Requirement 2: Method Resolution Order (MRO) Support

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want the LSP to understand Ruby's method resolution order so that it finds the correct method when multiple modules define the same method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class prepends modules THEN prepended modules SHALL take precedence over the class itself
2. WHEN a class includes modules THEN included modules SHALL be searched after the class but before superclasses
3. WHEN multiple modules are included THEN they SHALL be searched in reverse order of inclusion
4. WHEN modules have their own mixins THEN the complete chain SHALL be resolved correctly
5. WHEN method lookup fails in mixins THEN the system SHALL continue to superclass chain

### Requirement 3: Advanced Mixin Patterns

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer working with complex codebases, I want the LSP to handle advanced mixin patterns including nested modules, conditional mixins, and dynamic mixins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are nested and mixed in THEN the system SHALL resolve the correct namespace
2. WHEN mixins use fully qualified names (e.g., `include Foo::Bar::Baz`) THEN the system SHALL resolve them correctly
3. WHEN mixins use relative names within namespaces THEN the system SHALL follow Ruby's constant lookup rules
4. WHEN a module extends itself with another module THEN the system SHALL handle module-level method definitions
5. WHEN mixins are conditional (inside if/unless blocks) THEN the system SHALL still track them for analysis

### Requirement 4: Reverse Mixin Tracking

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want to find all classes and modules that include/extend/prepend a specific module so I can understand the module's usage across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for references to a module THEN the system SHALL include all classes/modules that mix it in
2. WHEN a module is included/extended/prepended THEN the reverse mapping SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN finding implementations of a module method THEN the system SHALL show all classes that gain the method through mixins
4. WHEN a module is renamed or moved THEN the reverse mappings SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN analyzing module usage THEN the system SHALL distinguish between include, extend, and prepend usage

### Requirement 5: Mixin-Aware Completion and Hover

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want code completion and hover information to include methods available through mixins so I can discover and understand available functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting completion in a class THEN the system SHALL include methods from all mixed-in modules
2. WHEN hovering over a method call THEN the system SHALL show the source module if the method comes from a mixin
3. WHEN completion is requested THEN methods SHALL be ordered by MRO precedence
4. WHEN showing method signatures THEN the system SHALL indicate the source (class vs mixin)
5. WHEN a method is overridden THEN the system SHALL show both the override and the original

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer working on large Ruby codebases, I want mixin resolution to be fast and not impact LSP responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resolving mixin chains THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid repeated computation
2. WHEN the index is updated THEN only affected mixin relationships SHALL be recomputed
3. WHEN circular mixin dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL detect and handle them gracefully
4. WHEN deep mixin hierarchies exist THEN resolution SHALL complete within reasonable time bounds
5. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache eviction strategies

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want the LSP to handle edge cases and errors in mixin usage gracefully without crashing or providing incorrect information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mixin reference cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL log the issue but continue processing
2. WHEN circular mixin dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL break the cycle and continue
3. WHEN a module is mixed into itself THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately
4. WHEN mixin constants are malformed THEN the system SHALL skip them gracefully
5. WHEN the AST contains unexpected mixin patterns THEN the system SHALL not crash

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Ruby Fast LSP, I want comprehensive tests for mixin functionality to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mixin functionality is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all mixin types (include, extend, prepend)
2. WHEN complex mixin scenarios exist THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
3. WHEN edge cases are identified THEN specific test cases SHALL be added
4. WHEN performance requirements exist THEN benchmark tests SHALL validate performance
5. WHEN the implementation changes THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Mixin resolution SHALL complete within 100ms for typical codebases
- Memory usage for mixin tracking SHALL not exceed 10% of total LSP memory
- Cache hit rate for mixin resolution SHALL exceed 90% in steady state

### Reliability
- The system SHALL handle malformed mixin syntax without crashing
- Circular dependencies SHALL be detected and handled gracefully
- The system SHALL maintain consistency between forward and reverse mixin mappings

### Maintainability
- Mixin resolution logic SHALL be modular and testable
- The implementation SHALL follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Documentation SHALL be provided for complex mixin resolution algorithms

## Success Criteria

The module mixin support will be considered successful when:

1. **Accuracy**: 95% of mixin-based method calls resolve to the correct definition
2. **Performance**: Mixin resolution adds less than 10ms to typical goto-definition requests
3. **Coverage**: All major Ruby mixin patterns are supported and tested
4. **Reliability**: No crashes or incorrect results in production usage
5. **User Experience**: Developers can navigate mixin-heavy codebases as easily as simple inheritance hierarchies
