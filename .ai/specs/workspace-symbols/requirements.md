# Workspace Symbols Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive workspace symbols support for the Ruby Fast LSP, enabling project-wide symbol search and navigation across all Ruby files in a workspace. Workspace symbols provide a powerful way to quickly find and navigate to classes, modules, methods, and constants across the entire codebase. This feature leverages the existing RubyIndex's definitions map to provide fast, accurate symbol search capabilities that are essential for large Ruby projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Basic Symbol Search

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer working on a large codebase, I want to search for symbols (classes, modules, methods, constants) across all files in my workspace so that I can quickly navigate to any definition regardless of which file it's in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a class name THEN the system SHALL return all matching class definitions across the workspace
2. WHEN I search for a module name THEN the system SHALL return all matching module definitions across the workspace
3. WHEN I search for a method name THEN the system SHALL return all matching method definitions across the workspace
4. WHEN I search for a constant name THEN the system SHALL return all matching constant definitions across the workspace
5. WHEN I search with partial text THEN the system SHALL return symbols that contain the search text
6. WHEN I search with case variations THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching by default

### Requirement 2: Symbol Information and Context

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want detailed information about each symbol in search results so that I can understand the context and choose the correct symbol when multiple matches exist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a symbol is returned THEN it SHALL include the symbol name, kind, and location
2. WHEN a symbol is a method THEN it SHALL include the containing class/module and method type (instance/class)
3. WHEN a symbol is a class THEN it SHALL include inheritance information if available
4. WHEN a symbol is a module THEN it SHALL include mixin information (includes, extends, prepends)
5. WHEN a symbol has visibility modifiers THEN the visibility SHALL be indicated in the symbol information
6. WHEN multiple symbols have the same name THEN they SHALL be distinguished by their fully qualified names

### Requirement 3: Fast Symbol Lookup Using RubyIndex

**User Story:** As a developer working on a large Ruby project, I want workspace symbol search to be fast and responsive so that it doesn't interrupt my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for symbols THEN the system SHALL use the existing RubyIndex.definitions map for O(1) lookup performance
2. WHEN the index is populated THEN symbol search SHALL complete within 50ms for typical queries
3. WHEN searching with wildcards or partial matches THEN the system SHALL efficiently filter the definitions map
4. WHEN the workspace contains thousands of symbols THEN search performance SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN files are modified THEN the symbol search SHALL reflect updated definitions immediately
6. WHEN memory usage is considered THEN the system SHALL reuse existing index data without duplication

### Requirement 4: Advanced Search Capabilities

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want advanced search features like filtering by symbol type and using patterns so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for in large codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to search only for classes THEN I SHALL be able to filter results by SymbolKind::Class
2. WHEN I want to search only for methods THEN I SHALL be able to filter results by SymbolKind::Method
3. WHEN I use wildcard patterns THEN the system SHALL support basic glob-style matching
4. WHEN I search with qualified names THEN the system SHALL support searching by fully qualified names
5. WHEN I search for method names THEN I SHALL be able to distinguish between instance and class methods
6. WHEN I search with regex patterns THEN the system SHALL support basic regular expression matching

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Index

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Ruby Fast LSP, I want workspace symbols to seamlessly integrate with the existing indexing system so that it leverages all the work already done for definitions and references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RubyIndex is updated THEN workspace symbols SHALL automatically reflect the changes
2. WHEN entries are added to the index THEN they SHALL be immediately searchable via workspace symbols
3. WHEN entries are removed from the index THEN they SHALL no longer appear in search results
4. WHEN the index contains method entries THEN workspace symbols SHALL use the methods_by_name map for efficient method lookup
5. WHEN the index contains mixin information THEN workspace symbols SHALL include mixin relationships in results
6. WHEN the index tracks reverse mixins THEN workspace symbols SHALL leverage this for enhanced search capabilities

### Requirement 6: LSP Protocol Compliance

**User Story:** As a user of VS Code or other LSP-compatible editors, I want workspace symbols to work seamlessly with my editor's symbol search functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor requests workspace symbols THEN the system SHALL respond with proper `workspace/symbol` LSP messages
2. WHEN returning symbols THEN they SHALL use standard LSP `SymbolInformation` or `WorkspaceSymbol` structures
3. WHEN symbols have locations THEN they SHALL include accurate URI and range information
4. WHEN symbols have kinds THEN they SHALL use appropriate LSP `SymbolKind` values
5. WHEN the client supports it THEN the system SHALL return `WorkspaceSymbol` with location links
6. WHEN the client doesn't support location links THEN the system SHALL fall back to `SymbolInformation`

### Requirement 7: Symbol Ranking and Relevance

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want search results to be ranked by relevance so that the most likely matches appear first in the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple symbols match THEN exact name matches SHALL be ranked higher than partial matches
2. WHEN symbols have different types THEN classes and modules SHALL be ranked higher than methods for ambiguous queries
3. WHEN symbols are in different files THEN recently modified files SHALL have slightly higher ranking
4. WHEN symbols have different visibility THEN public symbols SHALL be ranked higher than private symbols
5. WHEN symbols are methods THEN instance methods SHALL be ranked higher than class methods for unqualified searches
6. WHEN search results exceed reasonable limits THEN only the top-ranked results SHALL be returned

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a Ruby developer, I want workspace symbol search to handle edge cases gracefully without breaking or returning incorrect results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workspace is very large THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable limits on result count
2. WHEN search queries are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN the index is being updated THEN symbol search SHALL remain available with current data
4. WHEN files have syntax errors THEN symbols from parseable portions SHALL still be searchable
5. WHEN the workspace contains non-Ruby files THEN they SHALL be ignored without causing errors
6. WHEN memory pressure is high THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully rather than crash

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer working on large Ruby projects, I want workspace symbol search to be optimized for performance so that it scales well with project size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workspace contains many files THEN symbol search SHALL use efficient data structures for fast lookup
2. WHEN searching frequently THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies
3. WHEN the index is large THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to avoid excessive overhead
4. WHEN concurrent searches occur THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without blocking
5. WHEN the workspace is indexed THEN symbol search preparation SHALL be done incrementally
6. WHEN search patterns are complex THEN the system SHALL optimize pattern matching for common cases

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Ruby Fast LSP, I want comprehensive tests for workspace symbols functionality to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workspace symbols functionality is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all symbol types and search patterns
2. WHEN large workspaces exist THEN performance tests SHALL validate search speed and memory usage
3. WHEN edge cases are identified THEN specific test cases SHALL be added to prevent regressions
4. WHEN the RubyIndex integration changes THEN integration tests SHALL verify continued compatibility
