# Seeds for failure cases proptest has generated in the past. It is
# automatically read and these particular cases re-run before any
# novel cases are generated.
#
# It is recommended to check this file in to source control so that
# everyone who runs the test benefits from these saved cases.
#
# NOTE: Seeds are only valid for the current test signature.
# If test parameters change (e.g., adding/removing inputs), old seeds
# become invalid and this file should be cleared.
