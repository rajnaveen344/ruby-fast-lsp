  # Returns whether or not automatic compaction has been enabled.
  def self.auto_compact; end

  #
  # When enabled, the compactor will execute on every major collection.
  #
  # Enabling compaction will degrade performance on major collections.
  def self.auto_compact=(flag) end

  # This function compacts objects together in Ruby's heap. It eliminates
  # unused space (or fragmentation) in the heap by moving objects in to that
  # unused space.
  #
  # The returned +hash+ contains statistics about the objects that were moved;
  # see GC.latest_compact_info.
  #
  # This method is only expected to work on CRuby.
  #
  # To test whether \GC compaction is supported, use the idiom:
  #
  #   GC.respond_to?(:compact)
  def self.compact; end

  # Sets or gets information about the current \GC config.
  #
  # Configuration parameters are \GC implementation-specific and may change
  # without notice.
  #
  # This method can be called without parameters to retrieve the current config
  # as a +Hash+ with +Symbol+ keys.
  #
  # This method can also be called with a +Hash+ argument to assign values to
  # valid config keys. Config keys missing from the passed +Hash+ will be left
  # unmodified.
  #
  # If a key/value pair is passed to this function that does not correspond to
  # a valid config key for the \GC implementation being used, no config will be
  # updated, the key will be present in the returned Hash, and its value will
  # be +nil+. This is to facilitate easy migration between \GC implementations.
  #
  # In both call-seqs, the return value of <code>GC.config</code> will be a +Hash+
  # containing the most recent full configuration, i.e., all keys and values
  # defined by the specific \GC implementation being used. In the case of a
  # config update, the return value will include the new values being updated.
  #
  # This method is only expected to work on CRuby.
  #
  # === \GC Implementation independent values
  #
  # The <code>GC.config</code> hash can also contain keys that are global and
  # read-only. These keys are not specific to any one \GC library implementation
  # and attempting to write to them will raise +ArgumentError+.
  #
  # There is currently only one global, read-only key:
  #
  # [implementation]
  #    Returns a +String+ containing the name of the currently loaded \GC library,
  #    if one has been loaded using +RUBY_GC_LIBRARY+, and "default" in all other
  #    cases
  #
  # === \GC Implementation specific values
  #
  # \GC libraries are expected to document their own configuration. Valid keys
  # for Ruby's default \GC implementation are:
  #
  # [rgengc_allow_full_mark]
  #   Controls whether the \GC is allowed to run a full mark (young & old objects).
  #
  #   When +true+, \GC interleaves major and minor collections. This is the default. \GC
  #   will function as intended.
  #
  #   When +false+, the \GC will never trigger a full marking cycle unless
  #   explicitly requested by user code. Instead, only a minor mark will runâ€”
  #   only young objects will be marked. When the heap space is exhausted, new
  #   pages will be allocated immediately instead of running a full mark.
  #
  #   A flag will be set to notify that a full mark has been
  #   requested. This flag is accessible using
  #   <code>GC.latest_gc_info(:needs_major_by)</code>
  #
  #   The user can trigger a major collection at any time using
  #   <code>GC.start(full_mark: true)</code>
  #
  #   When +false+, Young to Old object promotion is disabled. For performance
  #   reasons, it is recommended to warm up an application using +Process.warmup+
  #   before setting this parameter to +false+.
  def self.config(...) end

  # Returns the number of times \GC has occurred since the process started.
  def self.count; end

  # Disables garbage collection, returning +true+ if garbage

  def self.disable; end

  # Enables garbage collection, returning +true+ if garbage
  # collection was previously disabled.

  # Returns information about object moved in the most recent \GC compaction.
  #
  # The returned +hash+ contains the following keys:
  #
  # [considered]
  #   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
  #   objects of that type that were considered for movement.
  # [moved]
  #   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
  #   objects of that type that were actually moved.
  # [moved_up]
  #   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
  #   objects of that type that were increased in size.
  # [moved_down]
  #   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
  #   objects of that type that were decreased in size.
  #
  # Some objects can't be moved (due to pinning) so these numbers can be used to
  # calculate compaction efficiency.

  #
  # The +full_mark+ keyword argument determines whether or not to perform a
  # major garbage collection cycle. When set to +true+, a major garbage
  # collection cycle is run, meaning all objects are marked. When set to
  # +false+, a minor garbage collection cycle is run, meaning only young
  # objects are marked.
  #
  # The +immediate_mark+ keyword argument determines whether or not to perform
  # incremental marking. When set to +true+, marking is completed during the
  # call to this method. When set to +false+, marking is performed in steps
  # that are interleaved with future Ruby code execution, so marking might not
  # be completed during this method call. Note that if +full_mark+ is +false+,
  # then marking will always be immediate, regardless of the value of
  # +immediate_mark+.
  #
  # The +immediate_sweep+ keyword argument determines whether or not to defer
  # sweeping (using lazy sweep). When set to +false+, sweeping is performed in
  # steps that are interleaved with future Ruby code execution, so sweeping might
  # not be completed during this method call. When set to +true+, sweeping is
  # completed during the call to this method.

  # are not guaranteed to be future-compatible and may be ignored if the
  # underlying implementation does not support them.
